  `Life skill is a term used to describe a set of basic skills acquired either through learning or  by direct life experience.  This enables individuals and groups to effectively handle issues and problems commonly encountered in daily life.`,
  `They include creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, the ability to communicate and collaborate, along with personal and social responsibility that contribute to wholesome wellbeing of an individual. `,
  `
  Sure Trust was initially founded to empower rural unemployed youth by bridging the gap between knowledge acquired at the university and skills required by the industries in a dynamic environment. To address this issue certain technical courses such as AI, Python , Machine Learning , Project Management and Spoken English were launched. Overtime, these courses exponentially grew to 40+ in number, catering to different needs of the industry.
  `,
  `However, some of us felt , mere technical or academic knowledge does not make an individual wholesome. There is a dire need to unleash the latent potential of a student. Every student is unique regardless of what background he/she comes from or what qualifications they have secured during their undergrad program. It is to tap and elicit this ‘uniqueness’ in them and also nurture it, we decided to launch ‘Lifeskills Training Sessions’ . They now become an asset to their company and immediate neighborhood. `,
