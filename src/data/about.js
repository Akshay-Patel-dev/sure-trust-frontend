    `I have had the greatest privilege of being a student as well as
faculty for 40 years in Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher
Learning, Anantapur Campus, Andhra Pradesh, India, whose founder
chancellor is Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. While my dream was to
continue to serve the Institution even after retirement, little
did I realize that Bhagawan had different plans for me. The inborn
passion for teaching and research; and the nature of “always move
ahead with optimism amidst all adversities”, made my mind debate
on how to put to use the vast knowledge acquired over this long
period of teaching, for the benefit of youth, especially living in
rural areas. So, I decided to set out on a journey to visit the
villages, around Puttaparthi, Anantapur district of Andhra
Pradesh, India, for assessing the requirements of educated
unemployed rural youth. While I was waiting for an auspicious day
to begin the journey, I spotted Mrs. Vandana Nagesh, in the
Darshan grounds in Sai Kulwant Hall. After she departed from the
department of Management & Commerce, Anantapur Campus in the
mid-1990s on completion of her studies, this was the first time I
met her. Having nurtured special love for all the students, I was
pleasantly surprised to see her; and picked up conversation. On
listening to my plan during the chat, Mrs. Vandana instantly
offered to accompany me.
`,
    `
Our journey into the villages, thus, began, for identifying the
missing skill sets in educated but unemployed rural youth.
Delightful coincidences during the journey made us feel that Swami
was hand holding and directing us in every step we undertook. The
search brought to light the twin realities of rural areas. While
most of the rural youth are qualified with professional degrees,
majority of them are idling at home lacking the skill sets needed
by the industry for employing them. This reality resulted in the
dawn of the "Skill Upgradation for Rural-youth Empowerment – SURE"
concept. Proceeding further, a brochure mentioning the programs
that are offered to enhance their skill sets was circulated. In
response, Mr. Jagadeesh, from a remote village in Anantapur
district, Andhra Pradesh, India, approached us. A detailed
discussion with Jagadeesh revealed that he is highly versatile
with Python program, AI, ML,DL, DS, and DA. Having good
communication skills and with Navodaya schooling background, he
said he discontinued M.C.A integrated program from LPU, Punjab, to
use his theoretical knowledge to build industry-related software
solutions, and thus gain the required capability to set up a
startup venture. completing PG diploma in AI and ML from IIIT,
Bangalore. Jagadeesh is currently pursuing MS in AI and ML from
Liverpool John Moores University, London, UK, through upGrad
online platform. Simultaneously Mr. Jagadeesh is sincerely
training batches of students in Python, AI, ML, DL, DS, and DA.`,
    `The overall understanding we gained from this village survey was
that majority of rural youth besides possessing good academic
degrees, have amazing talent and inexplicable zeal to learn new
things. With a little guidance to channelize their latent talent
in the right direction, they will undoubtedly become the dynamic
soldiers of Indian economic growth. We express our heartfelt
gratitude to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba for promoting us to
start this highly fulfilling service initiate, and sincerely pray
for His continued guidance.`,
